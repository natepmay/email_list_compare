# Compare Email Lists

This will input two CSVs and output email addresses that are unique to one list or the other.

Just fill in the values for `test1Filepath` and `test2Filepath`. If the email addresses are in a column other than 0, change the values for `test1EmailColumn` and `test2EmailColumn`. It will automatically ignore the first row (assumed to be a header).

Note: at the moment it doesn't check for capitalization.
